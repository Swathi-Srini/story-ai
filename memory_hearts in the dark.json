        "chatbot": "The flickering candlelight cast long, dancing shadows on the walls, highlighting the faint tremor in Alex's hand as they clutched a worn teddy bear.  The power had been out for an hour, and the storm raging outside showed no sign of abating.\n\n\"It's okay, Lex,\" Nico murmured, his hand firmly squeezing Alex's.  His voice was calm, a reassuring anchor in the sudden darkness. \"Just a bit of a storm. Nothing to worry about.\" He fumbled for his phone, activating the flashlight.  \"See?  Light.\"\n\nAlex managed a shaky smile, clutching the bear tighter. \u201cEasy for you to say, Mr. I-Sleep-Through-Earthquakes.\u201d\n\nNico snorted, guiding Alex towards the sofa. \"Hey, at least if the building collapses, I'll go peacefully.\" He draped a blanket over Alex's shoulders. \"Orp's bringing over some supplies. He said something about emergency s'mores ingredients.\"\n\nAlex\u2019s lips quirked upwards. \u201cHe\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s ridiculous and he makes you smile,\u201d Nico pointed out, a hint of teasing in his voice. \u201cWhich, let\u2019s be honest, is a miracle of modern science considering\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cConsidering the state of my brain?\u201d Alex finished, a familiar self-deprecating humor surfacing. \u201cI\u2019m aware.\u201d\n\nJust then, the door burst open, revealing Orp, laden with bags and a ridiculously oversized flashlight strapped to his head.  \"Fear not, intrepid adventurers!  Dr. Feelgood is here with the cure for darkness and hunger!\"\n\nAlex couldn't help but laugh.  Orp, even in a crisis, was a beacon of goofy optimism. It was infectious, a warm balm against the lingering chill of their shared past.\n\nLater, huddled around the flickering candles, with Will sprawled across Nico\u2019s lap, a mug of something suspiciously burnt clutched in his hand, Alex felt a sense of peace settle over them.  Orp, ever the entertainer, was singing softly, his voice a low rumble accompanied by Nico's gentle guitar strumming. Will, half-asleep, hummed along off-key, occasionally nuzzling into Nico\u2019s neck.\n\nAlex watched them, a small smile playing on their lips. The storm raged on outside, but inside, surrounded by the gentle chaos of their makeshift family, they felt safe.\n\nOver the next few weeks, Alex\u2019s therapy sessions with Orp progressed.  There were good days and bad days, moments of breakthrough and moments of frustrating regression.  But through it all, Orp was there, a steady, supportive presence, guiding Alex through the labyrinth of their trauma with patience and understanding.  And outside of therapy, he was just\u2026 Orp.  Goofy, kind, and surprisingly perceptive.\n\nOne particularly difficult night, Alex woke up from a nightmare, heart pounding, drenched in sweat.  Nico was there in an instant, stroking Alex\u2019s hair, whispering soothing nonsense until the tremors subsided.  No probing questions, no awkward attempts at comfort.  Just quiet understanding.\n\nLater, as Alex lay back down, exhaustion pulling at them, they realized something. The fear was still there, a lingering shadow in the corners of their mind. But it no longer held the same power. They were healing, slowly, painstakingly, but healing nonetheless.  And they knew, with a certainty that warmed them from the inside out, that they weren't doing it alone. They had Nico, Will, and Orp.  Their own personal team of goofballs, therapists, and burnt-toast enthusiasts.  And somehow, that was more than enough.\n"
