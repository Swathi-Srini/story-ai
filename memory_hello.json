        "chatbot": "The flickering beam of the flashlight, pathetically weak, danced across the grimy, neon-stained alley. Alex, his heart hammering against his ribs, gripped the plastic casing like a lifeline.  This was it. The last flashlight. Percy, that lovable airhead, had somehow forgotten to pay the electricity bill *again*, plunging their ramshackle apartment into a week-long blackout. A week of stumbling around in near darkness, a week of relying on dwindling batteries, a week of Alex\u2019s high-pitched, decidedly un-cyberpunk squeaks echoing through the halls.\n\n\u201cJust a little further, Alex,\u201d Nico\u2019s voice, calm and dry as always, filtered through the gloom. Nico, blessed with night vision that would make a cat envious, had become Alex\u2019s reluctant seeing-eye ghost.\n\nAlex shuffled forward, the flashlight beam illuminating dust motes dancing in the stale air.  \"Easy for you to say,\" he muttered, his voice barely above a whisper. \"You're basically a human bat.\"\n\n\u201cBats are mammals, Nico,\u201d Will chimed in helpfully from somewhere behind them, his voice muffled by a stack of scavenged circuit boards. \"Nico's more like\u2026 a nocturnal reptile. Maybe a gecko?\"\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to stick with bat,\u201d Nico deadpanned.\n\nAlex, meanwhile, had encountered an obstacle.  \u201cOof!\u201d A small, undignified squeak escaped his lips as his shin connected with the sharp corner of a discarded crate.  The flashlight beam jerked wildly, briefly illuminating a rat gnawing on a discarded data chip before plunging them back into semi-darkness.\n\n\u201cEverything okay, Alex?\u201d  Nico\u2019s voice was closer now, tinged with amusement he didn't bother to hide.\n\n\u201cJust peachy,\u201d Alex grumbled, rubbing his shin. \u201cJust communing with the local wildlife.\u201d\n\nNico sighed, a sound like wind rustling through dry leaves. \"Here, grab my hand. You're about to walk into a pile of discarded cybernetic limbs.\"\n\nAlex, not wanting to test the veracity of that statement, gratefully grasped Nico\u2019s outstretched hand.  It was cool and surprisingly steady. Nico guided him around the obstacle with an ease that made Alex feel both pathetically reliant and strangely safe.\n\n\"Remind me again why *I'm* the one rummaging through this junk heap?\" Alex asked, his voice tight with anxiety.\n\n\"Because,\" Will said, his voice emerging from the gloom as he approached, \"you\u2019re the only one of us small enough to fit through that access panel where Percy stashed the emergency flashlights\u2026 after he used them to play shadow puppets.\"\n\nAlex groaned.  Of course.  Percy. Shadow puppets.  The apocalypse was nigh, and their biggest problem wasn't killer robots or rogue AI, it was Percy's inability to adult.\n\nFinally, after what felt like an eternity of navigating a treacherous landscape of discarded tech and lurking shadows, they reached the access panel.  Alex, guided by Nico\u2019s instructions and Will\u2019s occasional illuminating burst from his own nearly-dead flashlight, squeezed through the narrow opening.\n\nA moment later, he emerged triumphant, holding aloft not one, not two, but three flashlights.\n\n\u201cScore!\u201d Will cheered, momentarily forgetting his dwindling battery power.\n\nNico just smirked.  \"See?  No need to squeak.\"\n\nAlex, feeling a flicker of bravado return, grinned.  \"Hey, a little squeak never hurt anyone.\"  He flicked on one of the new flashlights, bathing the alley in a blessedly strong beam of light.  \"Now, who's up for some shadow puppets?\"\n\n\n"
